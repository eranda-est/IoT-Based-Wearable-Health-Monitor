# Wearable IoT Device for Monitoring Patients with Walking Disabilities

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and developing a wearable IoT device for monitoring the health of patients with walking disabilities in rehabilitation. The device performs the following tasks:

- **Step Counting:** Accurately counts daily steps using gyroscope data.
- **Emergency Notification:** Detects falls and sends alerts to responsible persons.
- **Movement Classification (Optional):** Identifies walking patterns such as walking, jogging, and running using machine learning.
- **Web Dashboard:** Displays collected statistics for monitoring purposes.

## Features
- **Gyroscope-Based Step Counting**: Improves accuracy over traditional accelerometer-based pedometers.
- **Emergency Alert System**: Detects falls and notifies caregivers.
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Classifies different movement patterns.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays real-time statistics collected by the wearable device.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** MPU6050 Gyroscope & Accelerometer, Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)
- **Software:** Python, C++, Node.js
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - **Embedded Development:** Arduino IDE, MicroPython
  - **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas
  - **Machine Learning (Optional):** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
  - **Web Dashboard:** React, Flask, Firebase, MQTT
